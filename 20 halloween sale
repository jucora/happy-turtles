Julian's code:

let videoGame = 0;
    
    while (s >= p) { 
        videoGame++;
        s -= p; 
        if (p - d > m) {p -= d;}
        else {p = m;}
    }
    return videoGame;
    
    ThaÃ­s's code: 
    
    function howManyGames(p, d, m, s) {
    // Return the number of games you can buy
    
    let possibleBuy=0; 
    
    while (s>=p) { //while the total money(s) is greater than the price of the game(m):
        s -= p; //the money(s) will be reduced by the price of the current game
        possibleBuy++; //and one game will be added on the amount of games bought
        
        if ((p-d)>=m) { //if the 'price minus the discount' is greater or equal than minimum price(m)
            p -= d; //the price will be reduced in d units;
            
        }else {
            p=m; //minimum price;
        }
    }
      return possibleBuy;
}
